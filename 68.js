// Chapter Nine - Functionl Programming with JavaScript.

// 1. What is functional programming?
'Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.'

// Three main concepts of functional programming are:
' 1. Pure functions'
' 2. First-class functions'
' 3. Higher-order functions'


/**
// 2. What is a pure function?
'A pure function is a function where the return value is determined by its input values, without observable side effects.'

// 3. What is immutability?
'Immutability is a core concept of functional programming and it means once a value is created, it cannot be changed.'

// 4. What is referential transparency?
'Referential transparency is a property of pure functions. It states that a function should consistently return the same result for the same input.'

// 5. What is a higher-order function?
'A higher-order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.'

// 6. What is a first-class function?
'First-class functions are functions that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.'

// 7. What is a closure?
'A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state.'

// 8. What is currying?
'Currying is the process of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument.'

// 9. What is a memoization?
'Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.'

// 10. What is composition?
'Composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function.'

// 11. What is a functor?
'A functor is an object that implements a map method, which applies a given function to each element of the functor.'

// 12. What is a monad?
'A monad is a design pattern used to handle the sequencing of operations in a functional programming language.'

// 13. What is a stream?
'A stream is a sequence of data elements made available over time.'

// 14. What is a reactive programming?
'Reactive programming is a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change.'
